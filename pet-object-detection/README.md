# Pet detection Demo

## Description

This repository contains code for the Pet detection demo project using Daily and Cerebrium. In this example, we have a bot that monitors each participants screen
for a cat or dog using a YOLOv8 model. If a pet is detected in any participants frame, the bot posts a frame of it to the call with bounding boxes around the pet.

## Deployment Instructions
You can deploy the example below in just a few easy steps.
1. Git Clone the repository and make sure you are in the pet-object-detection folder
2. Sign up at https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai since we will need to get our API keys to deploy this example.
3. Run the following command in your terminal: `pip install --upgrade cerebrium``.
4. Run the following command in your terminal: `cerebrium login <private_api_key>``. The private-api_key can be found on your Cerebrium dashboard.
5. Run the command cerebrium deploy --config-file ./config.yaml
6. Your deployment will take about a minute or 2 since we are setting up your environment. Don't worry, subsequent deployments will be much faster if you make changes:)

Congrats your deployment should be live and you should see it live in your dashboard. You then should see a Curl Request in your terminal or example requests in your dashboard which we will use in the steps below to call our implementation.

## Using Pet Detector
This Pet detector example joins your call as a bot, silently monitoring every video on your call. In order to get it to join a Daily call, you need to send it the video
url you want it to join. This is done doing something similar to:

```python

```
